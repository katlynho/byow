# Build Your Own World

## Overview
In this project, I designed and implemented a 2D tile-based world exploration engine. By “tile-based”, I mean the worlds generated will consist of a 2D grid of tiles. By “world exploration engine” I mean that the software will build a world, which the user will be able to explore by walking around and interacting with objects in that world. The world also has an overhead perspective similar in style to the old Zelda video games.

I had learned how to manage and work with the large and complex code that comes with building a system like this. I also had the opportunity to create and design this from scratch, which was incredibly interesting, challenging, and insightful in regards to a future role as a software engineer. The difference between this project and every other course project that I had worked on was that there was no skeleton code given, just a general spec detailing what the end-result should do. Working without starter code for the very first time forced me to learn how to write code that "made sense", which meant moving code around into helper functions or other classes to make it cleaner and easier to understand. It also meant that I had to determine what subproblems to solve, what order and what was the best data structure, algorithm, and methods to use, and how these changes would affect other parts of the game. When it came to designing the user-facing components, I had to think about what features the average user would want and need, with each design decision being made in regards to what its goal was and how to keep users engaged.
